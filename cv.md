3. For the last 6 months I have been learning front-end development daily, practicing on my own, reading various books and solving exercises. But the one thing I lacked the whole time was a community which could make my learning path more exciting and fulfilling. I expect RS School to give me new interesting tasks to accomplish, new people to meet, make me more organized. I hope that RS could be of much help to find a good job, too. I'm grateful for such an oportunity to join your school and gain new knowledge and skills.
